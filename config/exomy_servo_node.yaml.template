## Add additional servos here by adding the pin, neutral and 
## range for each servo. Four servos are setup, as the Exomy
## Hat has 4 open slots
## The servo needs to be registered as well in the "src/servo.py"
## (exept the 4 existing ones)
## Be aware that adding a servo adds a value to the
## servo_angles message in "msg/ServoCommands.msg". You
## might need to adapt further code for example in the WebGui
## to control the servos.
## As every new message, deletes the settings for the other servos
## you need to set this in the coding.
